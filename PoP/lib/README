What Are These Libraries
------------------------
These libraries together provide TinySound with the ability to load Ogg files
containing audio data in the Vorbis format, or what normal people would just
call Ogg Vorbis.
If you intend to use Ogg Vorbis files with TinySound, just include these three
jar files on your CLASSPATH along with TinySound.  That's it.
